Index Maps is a mapping and spatial data services company set up by me, Alexei Schwab, providing support for mapping, spatial analysis and data automation. 

# About me
I'm a Londoner living and working in Cardiff since 2021. After dropping geography at school, I slowly became more interested in it again and ended up studying urban development. After several years working in housing and regeneration, in 2019, I decided to retrain to be able to make maps for a living. 

I have a Masters' degree in Geographic Information Systems and have worked for several humanitarian organisations
providing geospatial support. 

I'm a member of the British Cartographic Society and the Association for Geospatial Industry.

## What's important

## Skills and software
